- Group/Collection
- No order
- No duplicates
- Subsets
	- Partitions?
- Sets of:
	- Formulas
	- Vectors
	- Numbers
- Data Type (Programming)
- Set Operations
	- Union
	- Intersection
	- Complement
- Functions
- Venn Diagrams
- Set Notation
	- { 1, 2, 3 }
	- Universal Set
	- Empty Set
- The only thing that matters about a set is which things are members/elements of the set.
- $x \in A$ means "x is a member of A"
- **Ways of Defining Sets**
	- Set-list notation
		- { 1, 2, 3 } = { 2, 3, 1 } = { 2, 1, 3, 1, 2 }
		- { "foo", "bar", "baz" }
		- { 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... }
	- Set-builder notation
		- $\{p + 1 \mid \text{ p is a prime number}\}$
		- $E = \{n \mid n \text{ is an even nat. number}\}$
		- $\{c \mid c \text{ is a valid python command}\}$
		- $\{x \mid x \ge 5\}$
		- English: E is the set of all even nat. nums
- Set Operations
	- Union ($A \cup B$)
		- $\{x \mid x \in A \lor x \in B\}$
	- Intersection ($A \cap B$)
		- $\{x \mid x \in A \land x \in B\}$
	- Complement ($\overline A$)
		- $\{x \mid x \notin A\}$
- The universal set
	- The set of all the things we are talking about right now
	- Being a member of the universal set is implied every time we use set-builder notation
- Relative Complement/Set Subtraction
	- $A \setminus B = A - B = \{ x \mid x \in A \land x \notin B \}$
- Empty set
	- The set with no members is called the empty set
	- $\{\}$
	- $\varnothing$
- Cardinality
	- The size of a set
	- The cardinality of a finite set is just the # of members
	- | A | = the cardinality of A
	- |$\{1,2,3\}$| = 3
	- |$\mathbb{Z}$| is infinite
- Subsets
	- Def: A set A is a subset of a set B if and only if every member of A is also a member of B
	- We write $A \subseteq B$ (\\subseteq) to mean "A is a subset of B"
	- A is a proper (or strict) subset of B if and only if A is a subset of B and $A \neq B$
	- We write $A \subsetneq B$ (\\subsetneq) to mean "A is a proper subset of B"
- Powersets
	- The powerset of A is the set whose members are the subsets of A
	- We write $\mathcal{P} (A)$ to mean "the powerset of A"
	- Thm: For a finite set A
		- $\mid \mathcal{P} (A) \mid = 2^{\mid A \mid}$
- Supersets
	- If A is a subset of B, then B is a superset of A
		- We write $B \supseteq A$ to mean "B is a superset of A"
