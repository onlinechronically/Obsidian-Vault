	- Partitions?
- Sets of:
	- Formulas
	- Vectors
	- [[Numbers]]
- Data Type (Programming)
- Set Operations
	- Union
	- Intersection
	- Complement
- Functions
- Venn Diagrams
- Set Notation
	- { 1, 2, 3 }
	- Universal Set
	- Empty Set
- The only thing that matters about a set is which things are members/elements of the set.
- $x \in A$ means "x is a member of A"
- **Ways of Defining Sets**
	- Set-list notation
		- { 1, 2, 3 } = { 2, 3, 1 } = { 2, 1, 3, 1, 2 }
		- { "foo", "bar", "baz" }
		- { 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... }
	- Set-builder notation
		- $\{p + 1 \mid \text{ p is a prime number}\}$
		- $E = \{n \mid n \text{ is an even nat. number}\}$
		- $\{c \mid c \text{ is a valid python command}\}$
		- $\{x \mid x \ge 5\}$
		- English: E is the set of all even nat. nums
- Set Operations
	- Union ($A \cup B$)
		- $\{x \mid x \in A \lor x \in B\}$
	- Intersection ($A \cap B$)
		- $\{x \mid x \in A \land x \in B\}$
	- Complement ($\overline A$)
		- $\{x \mid x \notin A\}$
- The universal set
	- The set of all the things we are talking about right now
	- Being a member of the universal set is implied every time we use set-builder notation
- Relative Complement/Set Subtraction
	- $A \setminus B = A - B = \{ x \mid x \in A \land x \notin B \}$
- Empty set
	- The set with no members is called the empty set
	- $\{\}$
	- $\varnothing$
- Cardinality
	- The size of a set
	- The cardinality of a finite set is just the # of members
	- | A | = the cardinality of A
	- |$\{1,2,3\}$| = 3
	- |$\mathbb{Z}$| is infinite
- Subsets
	- Def: A set A is a subset of a set B if and only if every member of A is also a member of B
	- We write $A \subseteq B$ (\\subseteq) to mean "A is a subset of B"
	- A is a proper (or strict) subset of B if and only if A is a subset of B and $A \neq B$
	- We write $A \subsetneq B$ (\\subsetneq) to mean "A is a proper subset of B"
- Powersets
	- The powerset of A is the set whose members are the subsets of A
	- We write $\mathcal{P} (A)$ to mean "the powerset of A"
	- Thm: For a finite set A
		- $\mid \mathcal{P} (A) \mid = 2^{\mid A \mid}$
- Supersets
	- If A is a subset of B, then B is a superset of A
		- We write $B \supseteq A$ to mean "B is a superset of A"
- Ordered Pair/Triple/n-tuple
	- $(4, 5)$
	- $(5, \text{"foo"}, \{2,4,6\})$
	- For sets $A$ and $B$, the **Cartesian Product** of $A$ and $B$ is:
		- $A \times B = \{(a,b) \mid a \in A \land b \in B\}$
		- The set of all ordered pairs where the first component is a member of $A$ and the second component is a member of $B$
	- Fact: For any finite sets $A$ and $B$, $\mid A \times B \mid = |A| \cdot |B|$
- Properties/Sets
	- Being an even number, $\{2n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
	- Being a member of $A$, $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$
	- Relationships
		- **Relations**: A set of ordered pairs where the first component is a member of $A$ and the second component is a member of $B$ is called a relation from $A$ to $B$
			- $A$ is the domain
			- $B$ is the codomain
			- if the domain and the codomain are the same set $A$, we say it is a relation on $A$
		- The Cartesian Product $A \times B$ is the biggest possible relation from $A$ to $B$
		- Every relation from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$
		- Properties but about how things relate to each other
		- $x \geq y$, $\{(x,y) \mid x \geq y\}$
		- One string being a substring of another, $\{(s,t) \mid \text{s is a substring of t}\}$
		- Ways to define relation:
			- Set-builder notation
				- $G' = \{(x,y) \mid x > y\}$
				- $G = \{(x,y) \mid x \geq y\}$
				- $E = \{(n, m) \mid n + m \text{ is even}\}$
				- $S = \{(s,t) \mid \text{the first symbol in } s = \text{the last symbol in } s\}$
			- Set-list notation
				- $R = \{(1,a), (2,b), (2,c), (3,c)\} \text{ from } A \text{ to } B$
				- $R_2 = \{(1,2),(2,3),(3,5),(5,1)\} \text{ on } A$
				- The greater than or equal to relation
				- The substring relation
			- Directed Graph
		- Notations for Relations
			- The following are the same thing:
				- $(2,b) \in R$
				- $R(2,b)$ - "prefix" notation
				- $2Rb$ - "infix" notation
		- Properties of Relations
			- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is reflexive if and only if **for every** $x \in A$, $R(x, x)$
				- (everything is related to itself)
				- $G$ is reflexive because for every $x \in \mathbb{Z}$, $G(x,x)$ since $x \geq x$
				- The substring relation is reflexive, because every string is a substring for itself
				- $F = \{(n,m) \mid n+m=5\}$ is not reflexive because $\neg F(3, 3) = 3+3 = 6 \neq 5$
				- $S = \{(s, t) \mid \text{the first char in } s = \text{the last char in } t\}$
			- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is antireflexive if and only if **for every** $x \in A$, $\neg R(x,x)$
				- (nothing is related to itself)
				- $G'$ is antireflexive because for every $x \in \mathbb{Z}$, $\neg G'(x,x)$ since $x > x$ is false
				- $S = \{(s, t) \mid \text{the first char in } s = \text{the last char in } t\}$
					- is not antireflexive for the counterexample of $S(\text{"racecar"})$
			- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is symmetric if and only if **for all** $x,y \in A$, if $R(x,y)$, then $R(y,x)$
			- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is antisymmetric if and only if **for all** $x,y \in A$, if $R(x,y)$ and $R(y,x)$, then $x = y$
				- if $R(x,y)$ and $x \neq y$, then $\neg R(y,x)$
			- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is transitive if and only if **for all** $x,y,z \in A$, if $R(x,y)$ and $R(y,z)$, then $R(x,z)$
			- Functions:
				- Definition:
					- **Uniqueness**: A relation $R$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a function if and only if **for every** $x \in A$ and $y,z \in B$, if $R(x,y)$ and $R(x,z)$, then $y = z$
						- No input is mapped to more than one output
					- **Existence**: **For every** $x \in A$, there exists an $y \in B$ with $R(x,y)$
						- Every input is mapped to at least one output
				- A relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$ is a **partial function** if and only if it meets the uniqueness requirement for being a function
					- Technically, every function is a partial function
				- When we want to emphasise that a function really is a function and not a partial function, we say it is a **total function**
					- "function" and "total function" mean the same thing
				- Other Definitions:
					- A function $f \colon A \rightarrow B$ is **one-to-one** (an injection) if and only if for every $x,y \in A$, if $f(x) = f(y)$, then $x=y$
						- Two different inputs cannot map to the same output
					- A function $f \colon A \rightarrow B$ is **onto** (a surjection) if and only if for every $y \in B$ there is an $x \in A$ with $f(x) = y$
						- Every member of the codomain must be mapped to by at least one member of the domain
					- A function that is a **bijection** is both **one-to-one** and **onto**
			- Ways to Define Functions
				- Set-Builder Notation
					- $\{(s,n) \mid n = |s|\}$
				- English
					- The length function on Strings
				- Function Notation
					- $f(s) = |s|$
				- Directed Graph
				- Set-List Notation
					- $g = \{(a,1),(b,3),(c,3),(d,4)\}$
				- We write $f \colon A \rightarrow B$ to mean "$f$ is a function domain $A$ and codomain $B$"
				- Piecewise Notation:
					- $h \colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
					- $h(x) =$ $\begin{cases} \sqrt{x} \text{ if } x>0 \\ 100 \text{ if } x = 0 \\ x^{2} \text{ if } x < 0 \end{cases}$
					- $h(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4$
					- $h(-3) = (-3)^2 = 9$
					- $h(0) = 100$
			- Functions and Cardinality:
				- If there is a bjection from $A \rightarrow B$, $|A| = |B|$
				- If there is a one-to-one function from $A \rightarrow B$, $|A| \leq |B|$
					- For every input it must relate to an output. but not vice versa
				- If there is an onto function from $A \rightarrow B$, $|A| \geq |B|$
					- For every output, there must be an input that relates to said output.
				- **Definitions:**
					- Two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality if and only if there is a bijection $A \rightarrow B$
					- If there is a one-to-one function $A \rightarrow B$, then $|B| \geq |A|$
					- If there is an onto function $A \rightarrow B$, then $|A| \geq |B|$
					- Any set $A$ with a cardinality smaller than or equal to $|\mathbb{N}|$ is countable.
						- If there is a bijection $A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ then $A$ is countable infinite
							- $|\mathbb{N}| = \aleph_0$ 
						- $|\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}| = |\mathbb{N}|$
						- $|\mathbb{Q}| = |\mathbb{N}|$
						- $|\mathbb{R}| > |\mathbb{N}|$
