- **Writing Proof**
	- Pf: Assume $\neg \neg A \land D$ and $A \rightarrow (B \land C)$
	- Since we know $\neg \neg A \land D$, we can conclude $\neg \neg A$ and $D$
	- From $\neg \neg A$, we get $A$ (double negative)
	- Because $A$ is true, we can apply $A \rightarrow (B \land C)$ to get $B \land C$ (application)
	- $B \land C$ implies $B$ and $C$ ($\land$ - Elimination)
	- $C$ and $D$ together imply $C \land D$ ($\land$ - Introduction)
- **Guidelines for Semi-formal Proofs**
	- Only use the rules from this class, the 8 Natural Deduction rules.
	- One rule per step.
	- Cite the rule name.
	- Say which formula's you are using.
	- Clearly indicate all assumptions.
- $\vdash$
	- p1,p2,p3,pn $\vdash$ c
	- There is a (direct) proof with assumptions p1,p2,p3,pn
	- is valid iff premises $\vdash$ c
- **Proof Rules (Natural Deduction)**
	- $\land - Elim$
		- $P \land Q \vdash P$
		- $P \land Q \vdash Q$
	- $\land - Introduction$
		- $P, Q \vdash P \land Q$
	- $\lor - Introduction$ (Weakening)
		- If you know $P$, then you can conclude $P \lor Q$ or $Q \lor P$
	- $\lor - Elimination$ (Proof By Cases)
		- If you know $P \lor Q$, and you have 2 subproofs:
			- One assuming $P$ and proving $R$
			- One assuming $Q$ and proving $R$
		- Then you can conclude $R$ (outside the subproofs)
	- Double Negative
		- $\neg \neg P \vdash P$
	- $Introduction$ ($\neg$) (Proof by Contradiction)
		- Given a subproof assuming $P$, and proving $R$ and $\neg R$, we can conclude (outside the subproof) $\neg P$
	- $Application$ ($\rightarrow$)
		- $P \rightarrow Q$, $P \vdash Q$
	- $Introduction$ ($\rightarrow$) (Direct Proof)
		- If you have a subproof that starts with assuming $P$ and ends by proving $Q$, then you can conclude $P \rightarrow Q$ (outside of the subproof).
		- Given a subproof assuming $P$ and proving $Q$, conclude $P \rightarrow Q$
		- Extra
			- This is the method of assuming some set of premises and using them to prove other statements, eventually leading to some sort of conclusion.
			- You can use direct proof to show an argument is valid.
- **Reasons to start a Subproof**
	- If you want to prove an implication
		- (Start assuming the premise of the desired arrow formula)
		- (Set your subgoal to be the conclusion)
	- If you already know an or statement
		- (Start 2 cases, one assuming each part of the or formula)
		- (Try to prove the same thing in both of those cases)
- When should you start a subproof:
	- You want to prove a formula of the form $P \rightarrow Q$ (Assume $P$ and set $Q$ as your symbol)
	- You already know a formula of the form $P \lor Q$ (2 subproofs, one assuming $P$ and the other assuming $Q$, try to prove the same thing in both)
	- You want to prove a formula of the form $\neg P$ (Assume $P$, and try to prove a contradiction)

- Note: Any universal claim about all the things in a category that has nothing in it is technically a true claim. **We call these trivial claims.**
- So...Any argument with inconsistent premises is (trivially) valid.
- **The principle of Explosion:** something is not true if you can use it to prove absolutely anything.
- $\vdash P \lor \neg P$ - Law of Excluded Middle (need to use $\neg \neg P$)
